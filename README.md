# Key Features

- Simple and intuitive user interface for selecting a folder and starting the line counting process.
- Cross-platform line counter that works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- Supports a variety of file types including .txt, .py, .js, .md, .html, .css, .c, .h, .o, .cpp, .q, .rs, .jl, and .go (change for more in the code)
- Real-time update of the total number of lines processed with a humorous comparison to the number of lines in Isaac Asimov's "Foundation" series.

# Usage

1. Open the program with python and select the folder containing the files to analyze.
2. Click the "Start" button to begin the line counting process.
3. The results will be displayed in real-time in the GUI.
